To run, I created a conda environment with the sbi package installed from Mackelab, instructions here: https://www.mackelab.org/sbi/install/

I also conda installed a few other things, I'll eventually make a requirements.txt file.

sbi_3param... runs all the way through currently, thinking_about_noise.py is almost the same thing but with a better noise setup but it's failing to run the MSE SBI. I'm going to need to troubleshoot.
